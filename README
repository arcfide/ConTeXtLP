ConTeXtLP: ConTeXt-based, Minimalist Literate Programming
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is a minimalist literate programming system focused around the 
ConTeXt typesetting system.  You write ConTeXt files with a test of 
basic macros for defining chunks, and then you can extract the code 
from these documents using the ConTeXtLP.Tangle function.  There is 
no weaving, as you can just run the context program directly on your 
files. 

Pretty-printing is provided by the custom pretty printing support in 
ConTeXt.  Indexing and other features that you would expect from 
full-featured LP systems like CWEB are provided already by ConTeXt, 
making this a simple, but very featureful way of doing things.
